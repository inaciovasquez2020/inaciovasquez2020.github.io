## Scope

This repository hosts the **public website** for:

https://inaciovasquez2020.github.io

It functions as the **human interface layer** of the research ecosystem.
It does not host theory, code, or experimental material.

All scientific content is located in canonical repositories
registered under the **Scientific Infrastructure (URF)**.

This site exists to:
- provide discoverability,
- aggregate registry links,
- present institutional contact information.

---

## Scientific Infrastructure (URF)

All research is organized under the **Scientific Infrastructure**:

Root (truth layer):  
https://github.com/inaciovasquez2020/scientific-infrastructure

Website (infrastructure UI):  
https://inaciovasquez2020.github.io/scientific-infrastructure/

Canonical release:  
https://github.com/inaciovasquez2020/scientific-infrastructure/releases/tag/v1.0

The infrastructure defines:
- canonical modules,
- governance rules,
- citation surfaces,
- reproducibility contracts.

---

## Registry & Index

Public research registry:

https://inaciovasquez2020.github.io/vasquez-index/

The Vasquez Index functions as the **registry layer** above
the Scientific Infrastructure.

This website links to the registry and infrastructure,
but does not duplicate their content.

---

## Technical Dashboard

Machine-verifiable audit logs and artifact registry:

https://inaciovasquez2020.github.io/vasquez-index/dashboard.html

---

## External Canonical Results

The following results are closed, public, and independently citable:

• **Rank Dichotomy Theorem (CAT(0) cube complexes)**  
  DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18450375  
  Repository: https://github.com/inaciovasquez2020/rank-dichotomy-cat0
___

## Research Status

The Unified Rigidity Framework is **structurally closed**.

All internal mathematical content is frozen and versioned.
Remaining uncertainty is strictly external:
citation propagation, editorial review, and institutional uptake.

---

## Citation

This website itself is a citable interface object.
